The setup:
In order to run the app, one needs to have the Project_2.py, Project_Dash.py and the Project_Dash_html.py files. In addition, downloading of the computations_files directory and changing the FILEPATH constant in the Project_Dash.py according to this directory location is necessary. Another directory which needs to be downloaded is called Organs. The constant PATH in the Project_2.py file needs to be changed according to the Organs directory location. 
After all downloading and importing the libraries, one can run the application by running the Project.Dash.py script.

The setup: 

In order to run the application, you need to have the Project_2.py, Project_Dash.py, the Project_Dash_html.py and constants.py.
In addition, downloading of the computations_files and Organs directories is needed. 
Then the constant FILEPATH in the constants.py file needs to be changed according to the location of all of these files. 
After all downloading and importing the libraries (numpy, trimesh, pywavefront, scipy, plotly, dash, json and copy),
you can start the application by running the Project.Dash.py script.
